As you can see, in SPR-Violated  , we define a function called "ShowMemberDetails" in which we make two seperate operations, first we show every member's detail on console depend on their age difference to 45y.o; 
Then try to send a jsx to parent in which "member" plays a prop's role.
so ,the function is doing 2 tasks.


On the other hand, in SPR-Ok , we seperate the two tasks by defining two different functions. so we can call them in parent component one by one, and we're allowed to just call our favorite operation in a time.
